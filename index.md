## Overview

As Computer Science students, a typical school day is composed of staring at a computer screen which can feel very isolating. The BrainBows app is meant to be an app to encourage studying in groups as opposed to studying alone. While there is nothing wrong with solo study, studying with a partner or in a group can improve material retention and overall boost the mood of a study session. As more students begin to use BrainBows, it will facilitate a sense of community in the UH Manoa computer science department.
