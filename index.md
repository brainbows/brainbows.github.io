## Overview

The BrainBows app is meant to be an app to encourage studying in groups as opposed to studying alone. While there is nothing wrong with solo study, studying with a partner or in a group can improve material retention and overall boost the mood of a study session.

### Goals

* To encourage camaraderie and bolster social interaction
* Combat burnout by forming communities

### Sign Up Page

Users can sign up on the register page. The user will be prompted to fill out their name, email, and password. Because this is currently only available for UH students and faculty, we have a UH Email requirement. Also required will be the user's current grade level, the classes that they are currently taking ("grasshopper), and the classes they have taken and consider themselves "senseis" in.
